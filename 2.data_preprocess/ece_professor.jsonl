Along the first direction, we use single-cell multiomics to discover regulatory mechanisms governing the interaction between the epigenome, transcription factors, and target genes. This approach relies on methodological innovation, developing new Granger causal inference techniques to capitalize on the \u201cparallax\u201d between simultaneous but separate measures of cell state. In the other direction, we apply large language models to model protein interaction and function. These protein language models enable powerful new approaches to predicting and understanding protein-protein and protein-drug interactions.\n\n"}
