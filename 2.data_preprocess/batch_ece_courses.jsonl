A primary goal of this field is to understand how quantum effects, such as entanglement, can enhance communication and cryptography protocols. Furthermore, the tools and ideas discussed in this course are essential for understanding and quantifying noise and decoherence in quantum computers. These concepts have also found various applications in different areas of Physics, including quantum thermodynamics, many-body systems and quantum gravity.
