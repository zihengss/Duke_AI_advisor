He joined Duke in 2010, completed a 3 year term as Dean of Natural Sciences in August 2013, and also served as Interim Director of the Duke Initiative in Innovation and Entrepreneurship in 2012. Before joining Duke he was Professor of Electrical Engineering and Mathematics at Princeton University where he also directed the Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics.Before joining Princeton University Dr. Calderbank was Vice President for Research at AT&T. As Vice President for Research he managed AT&T intellectual property, and he was responsible for licensing revenue. AT&T Labs was the first of a new type of research lab where masses of data generated by network services became a giant sandbox in which fundamental discoveries in information science became a source of commercial advantageAt Duke, Dr. Calderbank works with researchers from the Duke Center for Autism and Brain Development, developing information technology that is able to capture a full spectrum of behavior in very young children. By supporting more consistent and cost-effective early diagnosis, the team is increasing the opportunity for early interventions that have proven very effective.At the start of his career at Bell Labs, Dr. Calderbank developed voiceband modem technology that was widely licensed and incorporated in over a billion devices. Voiceband means the signals are audible so these modems burped and squeaked as they connected to the internet. One of these products was the AT&T COMSPHERE\u00aemodem which was the fastest modem in the world in 1994 \u2013 at 33.6kb/s!Together with Peter Shor and colleagues at AT&T Labs Dr. Calderbank developed the group theoretic framework for quantum error correction. This framework changed the way physicists view quantum entanglement, and provided the foundation for fault tolerant quantum computation.Dr. Calderbank has also developed technology that improves the speed and reliability of wireless communication by correlating signals across several transmit antennas. Invented in 1996, thisspace-time codingtechnology has been incorporated in a broad range of 3G, 4G and 5G wireless standards. He served on the Technical Advisory Board of Flarion Technologies a wireless infrastructure company founded by Rajiv Laroia and acquired by Qualcomm for $1B in 2008.Dr. Calderbank is an IEEE Fellow and an AT&T Fellow, and he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2005. He received the 2013 IEEE Hamming Medal for contributions to coding theory and communications and the 2015 Shannon Award."}], "max_tokens": 2000}}

During my Ph.D., I did two internships atIBM Research, Almaden,and received aGoogle PhD fellowshipin Structured Data in 2011.I obtained my master's and bachelor's degrees in Computer Science fromIndian Institute of Technology, KanpurandJadavpur Universityrespectively.Research Interests I am broadly interested in data and information management with a focus on foundational aspects of big data analysis. My research objective is to help users with heterogenous backgrounds and interests leverage the maximum benefit from the available data. While my ongoing work on explanations in databases directly aims to assist users get deep insights into data by providing rich explanations to their questions, my work in the areas of data and workow provenance, probabilistic databases, and crowd-sourcing probes into compelling, fundamental questions that need to be answered to enable end-to-end processing and analysis of unstructured, noisy, and unreliable data in today's world while preserving its entire context."}], "max_tokens": 2000}}
