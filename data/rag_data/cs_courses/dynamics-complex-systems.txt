COMPSCI  524
An introduction to the quantitative description and analysis of physical systems with complex dynamics and how the properties of such systems change as parameters are varied. Part of the course will discuss dynamical systems described by just a few variables and related concepts such as model equations, phase space, linear stability, bifurcations, universality, attractors, fractals, chaos, and time series analysis. Other topics will vary by instructor and might include spatiotemporal dynamics, dynamical networks, and the control of dynamical systems. Prerequisite: MATH 216, the PHYSICS 161/162 sequence, and COMPSCI 101, or their equivalents.
