COMPSCI  724
Survey of current research topics that may include: advanced signal analysis (wavelets, Karhunen-Loeve decomposition, multifractals), bifurcation theory (amplitude and phase equations, symmetry breaking), spatio-temporal chaos, granular flows, broken ergodicity, complexity theory of dynamical systems, and adaptive systems (genetic algorithms, neural networks, artificial life). Emphasis on quantitative comparisons between theory, simulations, and experiments. Not open to students who have taken Computer Science 313. Prerequisite: Computer Science 524 or Physics 513; recommended: Physics 560, 563, or equivalent.
