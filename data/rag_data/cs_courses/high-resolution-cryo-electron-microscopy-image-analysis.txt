Cryo-electron microscopy (EM) is a Nobel Prize winning technique to determine the structure of proteins and protein complexes at molecular resolution. Computational imaging aspects of cryo-EM, including image enhancement, reconstruction, classification and burst movie processing used to determine the high-resolution structure of proteins in 3D. Overview of the structure determination pipeline, focusing primarily on the data analysis aspects of the technique including the application of machine learning and deep learning strategies to extract atomic resolution information from millions of noisy images of proteins. Recommended prerequisite: Programming experience.
