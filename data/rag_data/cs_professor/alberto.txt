Overview of professor Alberto Bartesaghi: 
Dr. Bartesaghi is an Associate Professor in the departments of Computer Science, Biochemistry and Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University. TheBartesaghi Labfocuses on the development of machine learning approaches to determine the structure of macromolecular complexes of general biomedical interest using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, cryo-electron tomography, and sub-volume averaging. Some of our targets include glycoproteins of enveloped viruses like HIV, Influenza and Ebola, transporters and channels involved in signaling and metabolism, GPCRs, DNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas surveillance complexes, and targets for cancer drugs. The lab also works more broadly in the fields of deep learning and artificial intelligence, computer vision, biomedical imaging, and high-performance computing.
