Overview of professor Sudeepa Roy: 
I joined theDepartment of Computer Scienceat Duke University in Fall 2015.Before joining Duke, I was a postdoctoral research associate in theDepartment of Computer Science and Engineering,University of Washington where I worked withProf. Dan Suciuand thedatabase group.I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a Ph.D. inComputer and Information Sciencewhere I was advised byProf. Susan DavidsonandProf. Sanjeev Khanna. During my Ph.D., I did two internships atIBM Research, Almaden,and received aGoogle PhD fellowshipin Structured Data in 2011.I obtained my master's and bachelor's degrees in Computer Science fromIndian Institute of Technology, KanpurandJadavpur Universityrespectively.Research Interests I am broadly interested in data and information management with a focus on foundational aspects of big data analysis. My research objective is to help users with heterogenous backgrounds and interests leverage the maximum benefit from the available data. While my ongoing work on explanations in databases directly aims to assist users get deep insights into data by providing rich explanations to their questions, my work in the areas of data and workow provenance, probabilistic databases, and crowd-sourcing probes into compelling, fundamental questions that need to be answered to enable end-to-end processing and analysis of unstructured, noisy, and unreliable data in today's world while preserving its entire context.
