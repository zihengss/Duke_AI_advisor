Course Code: ECE 543
Course Name: Statistical Optics

Description:
Theoretical treatment of the statistical nature of optical fields via concepts such as second-order spatial and temporal coherence. Especially focuses on the theory of partial coherence and its applications including imaging with partially coherent light, laser speckle, and propagation through turbid/random media. Prerequisite: ECE 270DL or graduate student standing.
