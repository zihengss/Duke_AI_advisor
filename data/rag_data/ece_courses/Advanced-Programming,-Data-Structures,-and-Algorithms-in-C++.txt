Course Code: ECE 751D
Course Name: Advanced Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms in C++

Description:
Students learn C++, data structures (linked lists, balanced BSTs, hash tables, graphs), Abstract Data Types (Stacks, Queues, Maps, Sets), & algorithms (sorting, graph search, minimal spanning tree). Efficiency of such structures & algorithms compared via Big-O analysis. Students learn multi-threaded programming. Emphasis on defensive coding, and use of standard UNIX development tools in preparation for students' entry into real world software development jobs. Strong C programming skills required to enroll. Those without such skills should take Electrical and Computer Engineering 551D instead. Instructor consent required. Not open to students who have taken or are currently taking Electrical and Computer Engineering 551D. Instructor: Hilton or Lipp
