Course Code: ECE 551DK
Course Name: Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms in C++

Description:
Students learn to program in C and C++ with coverage of data structures (linked lists, binary trees, hash tables, graphs), Abstract Data Types (Stacks, Queues, Maps, Sets), and algorithms (sorting, graph search, minimal spanning tree). Efficiency of these structures and algorithms is compared via Big-O analysis. Brief coverage of concurrent (multi-threaded) programming. Emphasis is placed on defensive coding, and use of standard UNIX development tools in preparation for students' entry into real world software development jobs. Taught at Duke Kunshan University in Kunshan, China.
