Research Interests:
My main research topic is the study of the coexistence of superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect. The highlights of this work include: the first observation of a superconducting current induced in the regime of the quantum Hall effect, realization of the quantum Hall-based SQUID, and the first observation of the chiral Andreev edge states predicted 20 years ago. The unique combination of the two of the most robust quantum states – quantum Hall effect and superconductivity – is interesting in its own right
it also promises future applications in quantum information science, e.g. for creation of topologically protected states and excitations. Other research directions of our lab include: multi-terminal Josephson junctions which we developed in ballistic graphene
thermal conductivity measurements
studies of the novel two-dimensional superconductor KTaO_3.
