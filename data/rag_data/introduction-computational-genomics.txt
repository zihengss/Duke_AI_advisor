COMPSCI 260: introduction-computational-genomics
A computational perspective on the analysis of genomic and genome-scale information. Focus on exploration and analysis of large genomic sequences, but also attention to issues in structural and functional genomics. Topics include genome sequence assembly, local and global alignment, gene and motif finding, protein threading and folding, and the clustering and classification of genes and tissues using gene expression data. Students to learn computational approaches to genomics as well as to develop practical experience with handling, analyzing, and visualizing information at a genome-scale.
