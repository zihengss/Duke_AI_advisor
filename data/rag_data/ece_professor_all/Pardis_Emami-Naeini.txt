Name: Pardis Emami-Naeini
Department: Computer Science
Short Description: Assistant Professor of Computer Science

Research Interests:


Bio:
My research is broadly at the intersection of security, privacy, and human-computer interaction. My work has been published at flagship venues in security (IEEE S&P, SOUPS) and human-computer interaction and social sciences (CHI, CSCW) and covered by multiple outlets, including Wired and the Wall Street Journal. On the policy and advocacy front, I have been working closely with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Consumer Reports, and the World Economic Forum to inform their efforts toward designing usable and informative security and privacy tools for consumers.
