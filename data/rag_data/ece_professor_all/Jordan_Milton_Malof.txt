Name: Jordan Milton Malof
Department: Electrical and Computer Engineering
Short Description: Adjunct Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

Research Interests:
Application of advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to real-world problems

Bio:
I work with domain experts across different fields to solve challenging real-world problems through the application or development of advanced signal processing, computer vision, machine learning (especially deep learning) methods to real-world problems.  Recently, my work has spanned topics such as remote sensing, energy systems, and materials science.   My work has recently been featured in premiere machine learning conferences (e.g., NeurIps, ICLR) and computer vision conferences (e.g., WACV).
