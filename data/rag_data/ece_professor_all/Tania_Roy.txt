Name: Tania Roy
Department: Electrical and Computer Engineering
Short Description: Assistant Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering

Research Interests:
Energy-efficient electronicsTwo-dimensional materialsNeuromorphic ComputingOptoelectronicsWide bandgap materialsHigh power electronicsRadiation effects and reliability

Bio:
Roy's work focuses on developing hardware for artificial intelligence applications using novel functional materials including two-dimensional materials. By modeling computer architecture after the basic structure of synapses and neurons, hardware can be manufactured to be better adapted to pattern recognition algorithms. She also focuses on high-power electronics made with gallium nitride and other wide bandgap semiconductors. She is currently working on investigating the defects produced by ionizing radiation in GaN devices. She is particularly interested in studying the reliability of emerging devices and materials systems using electrical characterization techniques.
