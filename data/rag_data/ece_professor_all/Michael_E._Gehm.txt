Name: Michael E. Gehm
Department: Electrical and Computer Engineering
Short Description: Director of Graduate Studies, Professor of ECE

Research Interests:
Primarily computational and compressive sensing and measurement in all modalities (with special emphasis in Electromagnetic/Optical from RF to x-ray and all forms of Mass spectrometry), with side interests in optical physics, high-performance x-ray simulation, and rapid-prototyping as a means of creating advanced electromagnetic structures

Bio:
Michael Gehm received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis in 1992. He earned his A.M. and Ph.D. degrees in Physics from Duke University in 1998 and 2003, respectively. From 2003–2005, he was a Research Associate in ECE at Duke, followed by a year as an Assistant Research Professor. In 2007 he was appointed an Assistant Professor of ECE and was jointly appointed an Assistant Professor of Optical Sciences in 2009. He was promoted to Associate Professor of ECE and Optical Sciences in 2013 before returning to Duke as an Associate Professor of ECE later that year. He added a secondary appointment in Physics in 2021. In 2022, he was promoted to Professor of ECE and Physics.His current research interests are primarily computational and compressive sensing and measurement in all modalities (with special emphasis in Electromagnetic/Optical from RF to x-ray and all forms of Mass spectrometry), with side interests in optical physics, high-performance x-ray simulation, and rapid-prototyping as a means of creating advanced electromagnetic structures.He is a Fellow of both Optica (formerly, OSA) and SPIE.
